# Medical Chatbot Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project presents a Medical Chatbot developed with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, designed to assist users in obtaining reliable medical information. The chatbot leverages RAG architecture to fetch relevant information and generate natural language responses, combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative language models to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

* Contextual Medical Query Handling: The chatbot processes natural language queries and provides contextually relevant responses.
* Knowledge Retrieval: Utilizes external medical knowledge sources to retrieve accurate information.
* Generative Response: Employs a generative model to formulate responses in a conversational manner.
* Scalable Architecture: Can be extended to integrate with various medical data sources for enhanced accuracy.
* User-Friendly Interface: Built to provide easy-to-use, conversational support for medical information.
