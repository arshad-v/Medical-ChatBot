# Medical Chatbot Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project presents a Medical Chatbot developed with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, designed to assist users in obtaining reliable medical information. The chatbot leverages RAG architecture to fetch relevant information and generate natural language responses, combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative language models to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.
